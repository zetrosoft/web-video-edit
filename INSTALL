---INFO---
The program is an alpha / heavy-development phase, so if you want to use 
JBEdit you have to come close to the source and edit it by yourself!

-PHP

# ffmpeg -version

---INSTALL---
If you want to have less trouble as possible follow these steps:

0) ensure that mod_rewrite is working
1) copy the JBEdit folder in your Apache public dir
2) open the php/frame_gen.php and php/JBEdit.php files and edit the JBEdit_dir define to follow your needs
3) open the file .htaccess and put the correct RewriteBase directory
4) put a video called video.mp4 in the downloaded/ directory
5) give all permissions to downloaded/ and frames/ directories or change the ownership to www-data:www-data (or whatever...)
6) go with your browser to the JBEdit dir and enjoy!

After extraction wait the time of extraction and then you should find a new EXTRACTED_video.mp4 in the downloaded/ dir, or follow the link on the page.
